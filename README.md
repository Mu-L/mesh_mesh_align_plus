# Mesh Align Plus [Blender Addon]

Mesh Align Plus helps you place geometry precisely where it needs to go in your scene. You pick surface features that you want to align, and the addon moves your geometry according to your specifications.

Mesh Align Plus can move objects and leave the underlying mesh data unmodified, or it can move mesh fragments during the modeling process. You can also use measurements from your scene like angle differences, lengths, average positions, normals and other imaginary geometry like an implicit axis, projected points of intersection, etc.

Mesh Align Plus is designed to provide precision modeling capabilities, especially for hard surface modelers, mechanical, architectural and CAD/CAM users. See the simple demo clips below for a general sense of what the addon can do, read the <a href="https://github.com/egtwobits/mesh_mesh_align_plus/wiki">Wiki</a> above (with tons of GIF's), or watch the video tutorials on <a href="https://youtu.be/VBoic2MIC8U">YouTube</a>.
